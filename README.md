# OCR
Character Recognizer

The aim of this project is to develop such a tool which takes anImage as input and extract characters (alphabets, digits, symbols).
To provide an easy user interface to input the object image and retrieve the text present in the image and display to the user.

First of all you should download the OpenCV library (version 3.x).The
dataset we are using in this project is “opencv_python_knn_character”
dataset.
Step1:-Create a folder on desktop.Copy Gendata and TrainandTest files
from the previous folder.Then copy the training and testing images into
the folder.
Step2:-Open IDLE which is a python shell.Open Gendata file and run
it.A new image will be displayed on the screen in which we have to enter
all the characters and say what the character is.Enter all the characters
and then the training of the data will be completed.Then two new files
will be created in the folder.

Step3:-Open trainandTest file and check the model how it is working
with the input data(test1) we have given.

Step4:-Take test2 and test3 as the input data and check how the model is
recognizing the characters.
